                <li>Bake for 13 to 15 minutes or until top of cake springs back when touched. (If using a dark-colored pan, begin checking for doneness at 11 minutes.)</li>
                <li>Immediately loosen and turn cake onto prepared towel. Carefully peel off paper.</li>
                <li>oll up cake and towel together, starting with narrow end. Cool on wire rack.</li>
