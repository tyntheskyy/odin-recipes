        <p>A delicious dessert, my family recipe is a secret (and I forgot it) so we'll be working with something different. 
            Hopefully it's as good as I know it can be, good luck fellow experimenters.</p>
            
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Dough for single-crust pie</li>
                <li>2 medium sweet potatoes (about 1-1/2 pounds), peeled and cubed</li>
                <li>1/3 cup butter, softened</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, room temperature, lightly beaten</li>
                <li>3/4 cup evaporated milk</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h1>Steps</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425°. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle; transfer to a 9-in. pie plate.</li>
                <li>Trim crust to 1/2 in. beyond rim of plate; flute edge. Refrigerate while preparing filling.</li>
                <li>Place sweet potatoes in a medium saucepan; add water to cover. Bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat; cook, uncovered, until tender, 13-15 minutes. Drain potatoes; return to pan. Mash until very smooth; cool to room temperature.</li>
                <li>In a bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs; mix well. Add milk, 2 cups mashed sweet potatoes, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt; mix well. Pour into crust.</li>
                <li>Bake for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to 350°; bake until set or a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 35-40 minutes.</li>
                <li>Cool on a wire rack. Refrigerate leftovers.</li>
            </ol>
